        <h3>Something about me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, as you can see on top, my name is Manuel, I'm 24 years old and I'm
          born and raised in Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my short life, I've tried a lot of different things. From
          dancing and singing, to mathematics and chemistry; all kind of sports,
          such as handball, basketball, etc. I spent my days playing the guitar,
          read books (I'm keen on fantasy/science fiction) and play videogames
          from time to time. Of course coding is an important part of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018 I started getting involved in the programming world. I did
          some courses and studied a lot on my own, but I got frustrated, so I
          quitted. The pandemic changed everything. I didn't know what to do so
          I decided to give a try once more to programming. First, I did a
          bootcamp at Henry, an argentinian platform to learn coding. Then I
          found out about this new program called BrightCode and i felt this was
          my shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the program is ending and I'm about to travel to Israel to work
          there, it's a dream come true.
